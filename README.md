Cool things Meatspacers have made that you can use with your Meatspace Chat experience!

* [Meatvox](http://meatvox.com): text-to-speech bookmarklet. It's like Dr. SBAITSO narrating <3
* [Meatylinks](http://www.meatlinks.hiiamchris.com/): lots of good music and sites sent over meatchat, so this aggregates links. repo is rozap/meatspace-links.
* [Remeat Control](https://gist.github.com/akjetma/7406264): trigger a meat snap remotely via chat
* [cl-meats](https://github.com/abelsonlive/cl-meats): follow chat.meatspac.es in the terminal (wip)...
